# Which board game to play? by Henrique Figueira

Heads up! This was my first-ever Python project, so go easy on me.

## DataCamp project - Proposed idea:

After a tiring week, what better way to unwind than a board game night with friends and family? But the question remains: which game should you pick? You have gathered a dataset containing information of over `20,000` board games. It's time to utilize your analytical skills and use data-driven insights to persuade your group to try the game you've chosen!
